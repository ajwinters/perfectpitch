# Perfect Pitch Trainer 🎵

**Perfect Pitch Trainer** is an interactive application designed to help users develop and refine their ability to identify musical notes by ear. The app provides an intuitive user interface for engaging, real-time ear training.

## Features

- **Interactive Note Identification**:  
  The application plays a random note, and the user selects their guess. If incorrect, users can keep guessing until they identify the correct note. Once identified, a new note is played immediately for continued practice.

- **Customizable Note Selection**:  
  Users can choose the range of notes to be played. For example, practice with all notes in the chromatic scale or focus on specific collections like the C Major Scale.

- **Data Tracking**:  
  The app records every guess in a data file, allowing users to review their performance and progress over time.

- **Chromatic Range**:  
  Notes are randomly chosen from the chromatic scale across multiple octaves. However, users only need to guess the note itself, without specifying the octave.

## Use Case Example

Want to practice recognizing notes in a specific scale? Set the application to only play notes from the **C Major Scale** and test your ear with real-time feedback!
